# Rural racial and ethnic dot density

This repository contains code for the rural racial and ethnic dot density map 
that appears in [Story 2 of our Rural Aperture Project series](https://ruralinnovation.us/blog/who-lives-in-rural-america-part-i/).

The interactive is composed of a `deck.gl` map with an HTML/CSS/JS wrapper that provides a simple 
interface for toggling dots on and off for the different races and ethnicities on the map.

Dot positions were created using the [sf.dotdensity](https://github.com/RobWHickman/sf.dotdensity) package from Rob Hickman.
